**Covid_19_EDA**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data, sourced from the Our World in Data dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and other related metrics, with a particular focus on country-level data such as that for the United Kingdom.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data to uncover patterns and trends in the spread of the virus, its impact on different regions, and factors such as vaccination rates, hospitalizations, and excess mortality.

**Features**
Data Loading: The notebook automatically fetches the latest data from Our World in Data.
Data Cleaning: Some initial data preprocessing steps are performed, such as converting date columns to datetime.
Country-Level Analysis: Focuses on specific countries for detailed analysis, demonstrated for the United Kingdom.
Visualizations: Potential to include visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib (not yet implemented in full in the provided cells).
