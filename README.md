**Covid_19_EDA**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data, sourced from the Our World in Data dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and other related metrics, with a particular focus on country-level data such as that for the United Kingdom.


**Features**

Data Loading: The notebook automatically fetches the latest data from Our World in Data.
Data Cleaning: Some initial data preprocessing steps are performed, such as converting date columns to datetime.
Country-Level Analysis: Focuses on specific countries for detailed analysis, demonstrated for the United Kingdom.
Visualizations: Potential to include visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib (not yet implemented in full in the provided cells).

The data used in this project is publicly available and maintained by Our World in Data.
It includes information on:
Total cases, deaths, and new cases per day.
Vaccination rates.
Hospitalization and ICU admissions.
Testing rates and other health-related statistics.
